# ETF Constituents

This tool enables you to inform yourself about the constituents in all your etfâ€˜s. So it helps you to build a diversified portfolio with ETF.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Heiss/ETF-Constituents.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x starter.sh
```

# Start the application

# Configuration

The `config.txt` holds all indices, which should be tracked with the software. The syntax per line: `INSTITUTION INDEXNAME`. E.g. `MSCI WORLD`.
